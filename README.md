# New York Taxi Fare Prediction Kaggle Competition
In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, you are tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of 2.70, depending on the model used (see the starter code for an example of this approach in Kernel). Your challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!


The evaluation metric for this competition is the root mean-squared error or RMSE. RMSE measures the difference between the predictions of a model, and the corresponding ground truth. A large RMSE is equivalent to a large average error, so smaller values of RMSE are better. One nice property of RMSE is that the error is given in the units being measured, so you can tell very directly how incorrect the model might be on unseen data.
